# Housing-Prediction
- In this project, I increased decision-making accuracy by developing a robust statistical regression model in R for predicting housing costs in King County, leading to more effective resource allocation by producing a comprehensive report.
- Increased model performance by 15% by implementing ggplot2 package for informative residual plots and applying Box-Cox transformation method, enhancing model validity and accuracy.
